### Statements

In a computer language, a group of words, numbers, and operators that performs a specific task is a *statement*. In JavaScript, a statement might look as follows:

```js
a = b * 2;
```

The characters `a` and `b` are called *variables* (see "Variables"), which are like simple boxes you can store any of your stuff in. In programs, variables hold values (like the number `42`) to be used by the program. Think of them as symbolic placeholders for the values themselves.

By contrast, the `2` is just a value itself, called a *literal value*, because it stands alone without being stored in a variable.

The `=` and `*` characters are *operators* (see "Operators") -- they perform actions with the values and variables such as assignment and mathematic multiplication.

Most statements in JavaScript conclude with a semicolon (`;`) at the end.

The statement `a = b * 2;` tells the computer, roughly, to get the current value stored in the variable `b`, multiply that value by `2`, then store the result back into another variable we call `a`.

Programs are just collections of many such statements, which together describe all the steps that it takes to perform your program's purpose.

### Expressions

Statements are made up of one or more *expressions*. An expression is any reference to a variable or value, or a set of variable(s) and value(s) combined with operators.

For example:

```js
a = b * 2;
```

This statement has four expressions in it:

* `2` is a *literal value expression*
* `b` is a *variable expression*, which means to retrieve its current value
* `b * 2` is an *arithmetic expression*, which means to do the multiplication
* `a = b * 2` is an *assignment expression*, which means to assign the result of the `b * 2` expression to the variable `a` (more on assignments later)

A general expression that stands alone is also called an *expression statement*, such as the following:

```js
b * 2;
```

This flavor of expression statement is not very common or useful, as generally it wouldn't have any effect on the running of the program -- it would retrieve the value of `b` and multiply it by `2`, but then wouldn't do anything with that result.

A more common expression statement is a *call expression* statement (see "Functions"), as the entire statement is the function call expression itself:

```js
alert( a );
```
